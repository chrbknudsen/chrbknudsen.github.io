## mc - midnight commander
Oh the nostalgia. It looks exactly like I remember Norton Commander!

Command: mc

Install: sudo apt install mc

## whatis

What does this command do? For when you've forgotten what it does.

Command: whatis man



## whereis

What it says on the tin. Where is that file?

Command: whereis myfile.txt

## ncdu - disk usage

Easily locate those ginormous files that need to be deleted. 

Command: ncdu

Install: sudo apt install ncdu

## htop - find processes

top in itself is usefull to locate the process that for some reason
needs to be killed.
htop makes it easy to actually complete the hit.

Command: htop

Install: sudo apt install htop


## alias - make your own commands

alias update='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade'

But that is only temporarily. Add it to your ~/.bashrc file, to make it 
permanent.

## Copy-paste

Ctrl+c and ctrl+v is not working on the console. But ctrl-shift-c/v is.


## Symbolic links

ln -s path/to/filename newpath/to/newfilename

## rsync
I have a Raspberry Pi Zero w, have connected to it using SSH from a laptop running Ubuntu. Now I want to transfer a file from the laptop, to the Raspberry Pi.

sudo rsync /path/to/local/file pi@raspberrypi.local:/home/pi
