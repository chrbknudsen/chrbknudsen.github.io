Og den vil jeg gerne ku' animere. Eller noget. Der er noget javascript et 
sted på todo-listen der kan bruges. Og vi ender nok med en omfattende
note med kode og sådan. 

Kan det laves i noget shiny noget?

Anyway.

The three body problem. Not the book. Not the series. But the problem from 
physics. 

Three bodies, having initial masses and velocities (momenta), orbiting eachother,
are left to their
own devices. Or at least left Newtons laws of motion and gravitaion. What
orbits will they follow?

There is no closed-form solution to that, that is we are not able to write an
expression that will return the result for time = 2, given initial values at 
time = 0.
We will have to do the calculation for time = 1, and then, based on that result
calculate the next step. The results are rather sensitive to the initial values,
and exhibits chaotic behavior. Are we able to do these calculations in R, and
visualise them?

We will have to be able to describe the positions of the three bodies at t=1, and
then calculate their positions at t=2.

So - let us define a coordinatesystem with origin in the center of mass for the
entire system. We do that, because that will either be stationary, or will move
with constant velocity.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
tribble(~x0, ~y0, ~x1, ~y1,
        0, 0, 4, 2,
        0,0,-4,3,
        0,0,-3,-3
        
        ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(xend = x1, yend = y1, x = x0, y = y0)) +
  geom_segment(arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.03, "npc")))
```
