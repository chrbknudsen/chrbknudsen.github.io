## How to respond to being disrespected with confidence:

A copy-pasta from somewhere on the interwebs

1.	Toss it back with a question: “What exactly were you hoping to gain by saying that?”
2.	Give them the Death Stare: Nothing says ‘not cool’ like silent judgment.
3.	Play it cool: “Sorry, what was that? I want to make sure I understand you correctly!”
4.	Draw the line: “Talk to me like that again, and I’m gone!”
5.	Put it on pause: “Hit me up when you’re ready to talk respectfully!”
6.	Lay down the law: “Let’s get one thing straight: that’s not okay. Don’t ever speak to me like that again!”
7.	Kill them with kindness: Smile, say ‘Thank you’, and just walk away. Sometimes, grace wins the day.
8.	Flip the script: “Would you be okay if someone said that to you?”
9.	Set the vibe: “I don’t do disrespect. Let’s keep this respectful or not at all.”
10.	Exit with power: “This convo’s over until you come correct.”
