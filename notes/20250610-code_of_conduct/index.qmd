In a lot of settings a code of conduct is apparently needed. I believe 
it is basically a panacea for peoples own insecurities, and a general way
of offering appeasement when we are too insecure to simply ask people to 
behave themselves. 

Code of conducts tend to be very long, and are only getting longer. Because
the ways people can be jerks are legio.

In some projects I have defined the Code of Conduct very short:

Noli turbare circulos meos. Or anyones.

If you do, we will nuke, delete, lock, close, ban, or whatever else is necessary, 
in order to have undisturbed circles.

But I have found a sligtly longer version, that neatly combines the "golden rule"
and a stoic approach to projects:


# Code of Adult Conduct

## 1. Principle of Charity

When interacting with people around this project try to assume the best of them. 
If something seems offensive start by assuming you've misunderstood. Treat others 
as you would wish them to treat you.

## 2. Principle of Agency

We all possess the capacity to chose how we feel as well as how we react. Other 
people cannot "make" you feel bad or "hurt" your feelings unless you allow them 
to. Choose to take responsibility for your own mental state and exercise your 
agency. Do not give other people power over you that they do not have; the power 
to trigger you. You have the ability to ignore most anything. Use it.

## 3. Principle of Focus

This is not the place for social or political activism. When interacting with 
people around this project keep it on topic. While here, the only cause you 
should be fighting for is the project's success. No distractions.

## Enforcement

Warnings followed swiftly by temporary or permanent bans to minimize disruption 
to the focus on the meritocratic project of software development.
