Little-known data about hired killers and their hirers, as well as their victims. As you can see, the primary motive for hiring killers is to get rid of a current or former partner, and these "clients" are usually women, who engage not only the hired killers but also other people who "help" them.
This confirms that women, through their intrigues, are capable of killing their partners and ex-partners just to avoid responsibility.
"These data on hired killings represent another source of information dispelling the narrative around “gender-based violence,” which says that women are more likely to be the victims of violence, particularly within intimate partner contexts. First, men are more likely than women to be murdered via a hired killing. Hired killings of men then contribute to the homicide total across all homicide types, with men comprising approximately 75% of homicide victims in the U.S. and Australia.
Second, relationship dissolution is a main motive of hired killings. In the U.S. dataset, 66% of the relationships between the solicitor and victim were that of current or former husband and wife. Moreover, 21% of the U.S. cases involved a relationship of paramour or sexual partner between the solicitor and killer, suggesting that the wife was soliciting the services of her new lover to kill her current or ex-husband. Nevertheless, sometimes the ex-wife hires a friend, stranger, or acquaintance to “do the dirty work.” One famous example of this is Patrizia Reggiani, who hired a hitman to kill her husband Maurizio Gucci."
