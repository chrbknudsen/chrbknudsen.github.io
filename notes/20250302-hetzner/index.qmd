Is it safe to have your website on a service from the US?
Probably. 

Is it safe to run it on a service from a country
led by a... somewhat unpredictable... president. Taking advice
from people who should either take more Ritalin. Or less
ketamine. Probably. 

Is it a good idea? Probably not.

This site has, and at the time of writing hosted on DigitalOcean.
Nice service. Affordable. The server is located in Frankfurt 
(I am here writing to people from the civilised world, so
it is unnessecary to specify the country).

But, DigitalOcean is an american company.

So I would like to move it to a service based in a civilised
country. Hubby says it should be Hetzner. So here we go.

Begin by signing up at www.hetzner.com. Remember to save your 
login and password to recover your 2FA-setup. 

You might also be asked to verify your identity using a passport,
drivers license or other document. 

In the upper right hand corner there is the usual small
person with information about your account. Next to it 
there are nine small squares. Click that, and chose 
"cloud"

You can now make a new project:

click "Create server":

And chose a datacenter with a location you like. I like locations
that are in countries not run baboons on ketamine.

We now need to chose the image we want to install. I prefer
Ubuntu - that is the same I'm running at home.

Chose a size. Even with a lower payment, 
I get more compute, memory and storage with
the smallest option, than I did at the american
service I'm leaving.

Here you should opt in to pay a little bit more for the IPv4-address from the start. Otherwise 
you will have to click around to find out 
where to add it later.
