How do we calculate easter in Excel? For a spreadsheet a colleague is making for our vacation planning at work.

There are several ways. The best place I've found is [here](https://www.contextures.com/exceleastercalculation.html). A site that I'm definitely gonna study closer.

One of the formulas - translated into a danish excel-context:

```{R eval = FALSE}
=AFRUND(DATO(A2;4;1)/7+REST(19*REST(A2;19)-7;30)*14%;0)*7-6
```

Place the year you what easter sunday for in cell A2, and it will return the 
date - in the numeric representation used by Excel.
