    "text": "Born and raised in the cheap part of northern Zealand, I moved to Nærum just north of Copenhagen as soon as I got tired of commuting to DTU. It took me an inordinate amount of time to graduate - mainly due to my intense involvement in the local student organisation.\nAfter graduating, the plans for a ph.d. were thwarted by cutbacks on environmental research and I ended up at DNLB as a subject specialist for chemistry. I have stayed there through a couple of mergers with other libraries and held a number of positions, including at the staff of the university librarian, managing the pharmaceutical library and currently coordinating the activities in the library Datalab.\nI live in Rødovre, Denmark, with my husband Kristian, who works in IT.\nIn my spare time I love tinkering with digital electronics and LEGO, experimenting with molecular gastronomy and trying to hit a piece of cardboard with a Walther GSP cal. 22."
