## Bio

Born and raised in the cheap part of northern Zealand, I moved to Nærum just 
north of Copenhagen as soon as I got tired of commuting to DTU. It took me an 
inordinate amount of time to graduate - mainly due to my intense involvement in 
the local student organisation. 

After graduating, the plans for a ph.d. were thwarted by cutbacks on 
environmental research and I ended up at the National Library for Science and 
Medicine as a subject specialist for chemistry staying there through a 
couple of mergers with 
other libraries. Currently that means I ended up in Copenhagen University Library, a 
part of the Danish Royal Library. I have held a number of positions, including at the staff of the 
university librarian, managing the pharmaceutical library and currently 
coordinating the activities in the library Datalab.

I live in Rødovre, Denmark, with my husband Kristian, who works in IT. 

In my spare time I love tinkering with digital electronics and LEGO, experimenting
with molecular gastronomy and trying to hit a piece of cardboard with a 
Walther GSP cal. .22.
